									<p>I am a mechatronic design engineer at ASML. I currently work on the controls and functional design for the DUV reticle stage. I have experience in object oriented programming with a focus on C,C++,python, and matlab. Through my current job and prior experience I am familiar with controls, path planning, Ros, gazebo, mechanical design, electrical design, Simulink, and microcontrollers. A collection of my projects can be found in the portfolio section. I also like making art. See the art tab if you're interested in some mediocre art. One day, I'll have made art that is slightly above average, just you wait!</p>
